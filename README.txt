Appointment Genie

Start date 25-May-2024


I started this project to learn about TDD and familiarise myself with properties and other OOP things in Python.

The aim of this program is to allow the user to schedule an appointment with a contact, add that appointment to
the user's calendar and send a request to the contact for confirmation.

Let's see how it goes.
